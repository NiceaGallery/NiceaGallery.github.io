            <p>Hello! My name is Khairunnisa Rahma. My interests, talents, and hobbies are fully focused on the field of art, especially drawing and painting. Since I was kid, I've been fascinated by the beauty of the art world. When I create a piece, I feel like I'm being myself and I find an irreplaceable joy in every step of creating something meaningful. Art is not just a hobby for me, but the foundation of my identity and how I interact with the world. 
            </p>
            <br>
        <p>Rapunzel from Disney's "The Tangled" is one of my role models because of her braveness pursuit of freedom. I am inspired by her unwavering spirit in seeking her identity beyond the restrictions that once shackled her. Although Rapunzel is confined to a tower for her entire life, her strong desire to understand what happens outside the walls of the tower reflects a passionate curiosity that manages to amaze me. Her passion to understand the unknown world shows that curiosity and determination can lead one to explore amazing new territories.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The consistent support from my family and the many exciting things I have yet to try continue to push me to grow and become a better version of myself. Both aspects provide positive energy and encouragement to navigate life with a greater spirit, opening myself to new experiences, and continuously learning from every opportunity that comes my way.
