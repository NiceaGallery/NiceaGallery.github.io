        <div class="text-box">
        <p>I titled this painting "today, tomorrow, and forever burnout" because in this painting there is someone who is experiencing a burnout phase due to the tasks that are piling up, especially during the pandemic. Burnout itself is defined as a condition of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion due to excessive and prolonged stress.</p>
     <br>
     <p>The clock number that shows 2:24 here I interpret as the number 224 which has the meaning of today, tomorrow, and forever. The person in this picture is trapped inside a cell phone as if he or she is trapped and has been living inside the cell phone.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>The fire that I drew above the person's head I interpreted as the contents of his mind that was already hot, burning, and chaotic. In this painting, I also added a picture of a cell phone battery along with a hand holding a piece of the battery which means that a person must be 100% ready without resting.</p><div></h3>

            </div>
            <img id="myImg" class="newImg"  src="image/lukisan/lukisan.png" alt="The Key to Freedom (2023) Gouache on Paper" style="width:100%;max-width:400px;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; justify-content: center; align-items: center; float:none; display: block; margin-top: 20px;  box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .25)">
            <div class="text-box">
        <p>This surrealist painting is titled "Key to Freedom". It features a woman confined in an iron cage, while a bird with a key in its leg flies past her. The woman is wearing a bright yellow dress, which creates a contrast with the calm green background. I painted the woman's face with desperation, just like a human being when trapped in the middle of an empty space.</p>
     <br>
     <h3>In this painting, the iron cage symbolizes the limitations, barriers and oppression experienced by the woman. The bird flying with the key in its beak is a symbol of freedom, opportunity and change. The bird has a brown color reflecting reliable strength. The bird also has wide wings, indicating the ability to fly high and explore the world. The key carried by the bird is a tool to open the cage, which offers the woman the opportunity to be free from limitations. The key also denotes choice and responsibility, as the woman must be willing and brave to take the key and open the cage herself.</div></h3>
